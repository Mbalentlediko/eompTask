      "My name is Mbalentle Diko, I am from Khayelitsha. I went to the Centre Of Science And Technology, where I got introduced to Information technology as a subject, and I knew I wanted more of what I was given there and then I knew that I belonged there and I will be going there. From a young age, I have been captivated by the power of the internet and its ability to connect people and revolutionize industries. As I delved deeper into the realm of web development, I discovered the endless possibilities it offers for creativity, problem-solving, and making a lasting impact on individuals and businesses alike. After matric, I applied to Life Choices Academy where I am still at, doing web development. Information Technology as a whole fascinates me. I am grateful to be in the Technology industry, and I am prepared to learn more."

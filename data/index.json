    "  My name is Mbalentle Diko,  I am from Khayelitsha. I went to the Centre Of Science And Technology , where I got introduced to Information technology as a subject and  I knew I wanted more of what i was given  there and then I knew that  I belonged there and I will be going there. From a young age, I have been captivated by the power of the internet and its ability to connect people and revolutionize industries. As I delved deeper into the realm of web development, I discovered the endless possibilities it offers for creativity, problem-solving, and making a lasting impact on individuals and businesses alike.After matric I applied to Life Choices Academy Where i am still at , doing web development . Information Technology as a whole fascinates me. I am grateful to be in the Technology industry and I am prepared to learn more."
